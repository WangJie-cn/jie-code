# Parity Checklist Against npm `src`

This document tracks what is already implemented in Python and what is still missing compared with the upstream npm runtime.

This is a functionality-oriented checklist, not a line-by-line source equivalence claim. Large parts of the mirrored Python workspace still act as inventory or scaffolding, while the working Python runtime currently lives mainly in [`src/agent_runtime.py`](src/agent_runtime.py), [`src/query_engine.py`](src/query_engine.py), [`src/agent_tools.py`](src/agent_tools.py), [`src/agent_prompting.py`](src/agent_prompting.py), [`src/agent_context.py`](src/agent_context.py), [`src/agent_manager.py`](src/agent_manager.py), [`src/plugin_runtime.py`](src/plugin_runtime.py), [`src/agent_slash_commands.py`](src/agent_slash_commands.py), and [`src/openai_compat.py`](src/openai_compat.py).

## 14. Mirrored Workspace Versus Working Runtime

Working Python runtime today:

- [x] `src/agent_context.py`
- [x] `src/agent_context_usage.py`
- [x] `src/agent_session.py`
- [x] `src/agent_slash_commands.py`
- [x] `src/agent_types.py`
- [x] `src/openai_compat.py`
- [x] `src/session_store.py`
- [x] `src/permissions.py`

Mirrored inventory / scaffold areas that still need real implementation work:

- [ ] `src/commands.py`
- [ ] `src/tools.py`
- [ ] `src/query_engine.py`
- [ ] `src/runtime.py`
- [ ] `src/services/*`
- [ ] `src/plugins/*`
- [ ] `src/remote/*`
- [ ] `src/voice/*`
- [ ] `src/vim/*`
- [ ] Large parts of the rest of the mirrored package tree

## 15. High-Priority Next Steps

- [ ] Expand the real Python tool registry toward upstream `tools.ts`
- [ ] Replace more snapshot-backed mirrored modules with working runtime code
- [ ] Implement real MCP support
- [ ] Implement hooks and policy flows
- [ ] Build a real interactive REPL / TUI
- [ ] Add tokenizer-accurate context accounting
- [ ] Add background and remote session modes
- [ ] Port more of the command/task system
- [ ] Close the gap between the mirrored workspace and the working runtime
